This analysis was done to review Bike rental usage in NYC and how trends identified there may be useful in bringing a similar business to Des Moines, Iowa.

## Methodology
Using Python and Tableau, the data was parsed and turned into meaningful insights.

## Results
The data showed remarkably similar check out times, ride times, and peak hours. What was remarkable was the simple fact that men were overwhelmingly more likely to use the bike service. The similarities in every other trait make it clear that more marketing and time should be spent appealing the product directly to female potential clients. The data is available for review in visualized form at the link below.

The results show a pie graph representing the percentage of riders by gender, a bar graph showing peak checkout time by Gender, a heatmap showing the highest usage hours by day of the week, and line graphs showing the number of checkouts and duration by gender and by hour of the day.

## Next Steps
I would recommend a map showing the birth year and usage rate by day, as well as an actual map showing the longest trips by Starting Station ID to better understand which stations the bikes leave from that go furthest. Supply is likely to be down, but demand high in these areas.
